            Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system that
            allows users to program games and play games created by other users.
            Founded by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in
            2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded
            in the programming language Lua.

          <h2>Gameplay</h2>
          <p>
            Roblox allows players to create their own games using its
            proprietary engine, Roblox Studio, which can then be played by other
            users. Games are coded under an object-oriented programming system
            utilizing the programming language Lua to manipulate the environment
            of the game.
