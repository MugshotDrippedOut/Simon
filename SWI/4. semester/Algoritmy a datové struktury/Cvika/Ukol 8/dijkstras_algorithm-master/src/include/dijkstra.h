/*! \defgroup dijkstra Dijkstra algorithm
 *
 *  \brief The module implements Dijkstra's alghorithm is used to find the shortest path between one
 * point and all others. The distances between points we're storing in array (structure \ref
 * tDijkstra), which needs to be initialized. Every distance in our array has to be set to 'INF'
 * (Which is defined as maximum value of unsigned) except one which is our starting point ->
 * distance between starting point and itself is 0, we don't need special algorithm to know that.
 *
 * The city is described in the \ref Data_t structure.
 *
 * Every city has its own \ref Data_t.id, \ref Data_t.name, array \ref Data_t.roadLength - each city
 * can have up to 8 roads, the road is connected to a city if the road length is greater than 0. If
 * the road length is greater than 0, then it is connected to a city, which we find in an array \ref
 * Data_t.roadCityIndex at the same index as the roadLength. distance is used as a value, by which
 * we sort our heap and we store here the calculated distance of from the starting city, so before
 * you insert city into heap, do not forget to change the distance value.
